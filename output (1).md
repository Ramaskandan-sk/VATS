**Song Lyrics**
(Artist and Song Name Unknown)

Always do it on my own so I gotta get through it
And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing
Never give up, never slow till I finally prove it
Never listen to the noise, I just wanna keep moving
Keep my head up when I act, head up that's a fact
Never looking back, I'ma keep myself on track
Keep my head up, staying strong, always moving on
Feel I don't belong, tell my thoughts to move along

Push myself to be the best, try with no regrets
Live with every breath, see my message stops to spread
And I had so many dreams, then you hit your teens
Life ain't really what it seems, try to find out what it means
Always do it on my own so I gotta get through it
And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing
Never give up, never slow till I finally prove it
Never listen to the noise, I just wanna keep moving

Yeah, I put out all the star, it's my only medicine
Yeah, everything I do, I'm just being genuine
Yeah, I'm sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
Yeah, I do just what I do, and I hope you let me in
Let me in, yeah

I'm grateful, oh yeah, able, oh yeah
I'm stable, oh yeah, no label, oh yeah
You know me, I have only a path, I'm lonely
But damn, I'm going to win

I wanna take love, I want the real stuff
Everybody listen up, cause I'll only say it once
I'm gon' show you how to path, if you want it bad
I'm gon' show you where it's at, yeah how you can get it back
Yeah, cause I ain't never done
I'll be number one, working out of heart
Until I get just what I want, yeah

Rise just like the sun, yeah
Fade out like a gun, shooter's gonna shoot in
I'm gon' shoot him til I fall, always do it up
But my own, so I gotta get through it
And the only thing I know, is to love what I'm doing
Never give up, never slow, till I finally prove it
Never listen to the noise, I just wanna keep movin'

Yeah, I put out all the star, it's my only medicine
Yeah, everything I do, I'm just bein' genuine
Yeah, I'm sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
Yeah, I do just what I do, and I hope you let me in, let me in, yeah
I'm grateful, oh yeah, able, oh yeah
I'm stable, oh yeah, no label
You know me, I have only a pet, I'm lonely
But damn, I'm going to rain, yeah
